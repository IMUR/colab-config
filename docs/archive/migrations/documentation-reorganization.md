### Design Principles
1. **Logical Categorization**: Group related documents by purpose and audience
2. **Clear Hierarchy**: Nested structure reflects document relationships
3. **Consistent Naming**: UPPERCASE.md for primary documents, lowercase for supporting
4. **Cross-Reference Integration**: Extensive linking between related documents
5. **Metadata Standards**: YAML frontmatter for discoverability and maintenance

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Content Extraction and Analysis

**Step 1: Complete Content Review**
