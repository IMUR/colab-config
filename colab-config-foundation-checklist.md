# Colab-Config: Foundational Requirements Checklist

## Critical Context
**THIS MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE ANY OPTIMIZATION WORK**

The colab-config repository is NOT YET FUNCTIONAL. Advanced features like Thunderbolt networking, distributed storage, and performance optimization are meaningless until basic configuration management works.

## Phase 0: Pre-Flight Check (Do This First!)

### Verify Basic Connectivity
- [ ] Can SSH to all three nodes (crtr, prtr, drtr)
- [ ] All nodes can reach each other via network
- [ ] Internet connectivity works on all nodes
- [ ] Basic tools installed (git, curl, text editor)

### Verify Current State
- [ ] Document what's actually installed on each node
- [ ] Check if ANY configuration management is working
- [ ] Identify what's broken vs what's missing
- [ ] Understand what "working" means for this cluster

## Phase 1: Establish Foundation (Required)

### 1.1 Repository Location and Access
```yaml
Requirement: Standardized repo location
  Priority: BLOCKING - Nothing works without this
  
  Tasks:
    - [ ] Choose location (e.g., /cluster-nas/colab/colab-config)
    - [ ] Ensure location exists on all nodes
    - [ ] Set proper permissions
    - [ ] Clone repository to chosen location
    - [ ] Verify all nodes can access
  
  Success: All nodes have repo at same path
```

### 1.2 Basic Git Setup
```yaml
Requirement: Version control functioning
  Priority: CRITICAL - Can't track changes without it
  
  Tasks:
    - [ ] Git installed on all nodes
    - [ ] Repository accessible (local or remote)
    - [ ] Can commit and push changes
    - [ ] Can pull updates on all nodes
    - [ ] Basic .gitignore configured
  
  Success: Can make changes and deploy them
```

### 1.3 Choose Configuration Management Tool
```yaml
Requirement: Pick ONE primary tool
  Priority: CRITICAL - Core functionality
  
  Decision Required:
    - [ ] Chezmoi for user configs? (recommended)
    - [ ] Ansible for system configs? (if needed)
    - [ ] Both with clear separation? (complex)
    - [ ] Something else? (document why)
  
  Success: Tool chosen and documented
```

## Phase 2: Minimal Viable Configuration

### 2.1 User Environment Management
```yaml
IF using Chezmoi:
  - [ ] Install chezmoi on all nodes
  - [ ] Configure .chezmoiroot properly
  - [ ] Create basic dot_bashrc or dot_zshrc
  - [ ] Test apply on ONE node
  - [ ] Verify changes take effect
  - [ ] Deploy to all nodes
  
Success: Shell configs managed consistently
```

### 2.2 Basic Documentation
```yaml
Required Documentation:
  - [ ] README.md explaining what this repo does
  - [ ] Which tool manages what
  - [ ] How to make changes
  - [ ] How to deploy changes
  - [ ] What's working vs planned
  
Success: New person could understand and use repo
```

### 2.3 Essential Scripts
```yaml
Minimum Automation:
  - [ ] deploy.sh - Apply configs to nodes
  - [ ] validate.sh - Check if configs are correct
  - [ ] backup.sh - Save current state
  
Success: Common tasks are scripted
```

## Phase 3: Verify It Actually Works

### 3.1 Test Configuration Management
```yaml
Validation Tests:
  - [ ] Make a small change to configuration
  - [ ] Deploy to one node
  - [ ] Verify change applied correctly
  - [ ] Deploy to all nodes
  - [ ] Verify consistency across cluster
  - [ ] Test rollback procedure
  
Success: Can reliably change configurations
```

### 3.2 Document What Exists
```yaml
Current State Documentation:
  - [ ] What configurations are managed
  - [ ] What's NOT yet managed
  - [ ] Known issues and limitations
  - [ ] Next steps clearly identified
  
Success: Clear picture of current state
```

## Phase 4: ONLY NOW Consider Optimizations

Once ALL above phases complete:
- [ ] Review Operations Guide v2 for optimization opportunities
- [ ] Consider Thunderbolt networking (32x speedup)
- [ ] Explore storage improvements
- [ ] Investigate service deployment strategies

## What NOT To Do Yet

### Don't Touch Until Basics Work:
- ❌ Thunderbolt networking configuration
- ❌ Distributed storage systems (Ceph/GlusterFS)
- ❌ Container orchestration (Kubernetes)
- ❌ Complex service deployments
- ❌ Performance optimizations
- ❌ Multi-tier storage strategies
- ❌ Advanced monitoring stacks

### These Are Distractions Right Now:
- GitLab/Gitea installation
- RAM disk optimizations
- GPU configurations
- ML platform setup
- Service mesh architectures
- Backup automation beyond basic scripts

## Decision Points Requiring Answers

Before proceeding, answer these:

1. **What's the primary goal?**
   - [ ] User environment consistency?
   - [ ] Service deployment platform?
   - [ ] Development environment?
   - [ ] All of the above?

2. **Who will use this?**
   - [ ] Single user?
   - [ ] Small team?
   - [ ] Multiple independent users?

3. **What's the minimum viable success?**
   - [ ] Consistent shell environments?
   - [ ] Deployed services?
   - [ ] Complete automation?

4. **What can break temporarily?**
   - [ ] User shells?
   - [ ] System services?
   - [ ] Network configuration?

## Red Flags to Watch For

If you find yourself:
- Researching Kubernetes before basic configs work
- Optimizing performance before functionality exists
- Building complex automation before simple scripts work
- Documenting future plans instead of current state

**STOP** and return to foundational requirements.

## Success Criteria for "Repository is Functional"

The repository is ready for optimization when:

✅ **Version Control**: Can commit, push, pull on all nodes  
✅ **Configuration Management**: At least user configs are managed  
✅ **Deployment**: Changes can be applied consistently  
✅ **Documentation**: Current state is accurately documented  
✅ **Validation**: Can verify configurations are correct  
✅ **Recovery**: Can rollback if something breaks  

## Priority Order (Do In This Sequence)

1. **Get SSH working** (can't do anything without this)
2. **Establish repo location** (everything depends on this)
3. **Pick configuration tool** (core technical decision)
4. **Implement basic configs** (prove it works)
5. **Document reality** (not plans)
6. **Validate functionality** (ensure it actually works)
7. **THEN optimize** (only after basics work)

## For the Local AI Agent

When working on colab-config:

1. **First Question**: "Does basic configuration management work?"
   - If NO → Start with Phase 1
   - If YES → Verify with Phase 3 tests
   - If VERIFIED → Consider optimizations

2. **Second Question**: "What's the next blocking issue?"
   - Can't SSH? Fix that first
   - No repo access? Fix that next
   - No tool chosen? Decide that
   - Tool not working? Make it work

3. **Avoid Distractions**: 
   - Thunderbolt is irrelevant if Chezmoi doesn't work
   - GPU setup is pointless if configs aren't managed
   - Service deployment is premature if basics aren't solid

## The Bottom Line

**The cluster doesn't need optimization, it needs basic functionality.**

Start at Phase 0. Complete each phase fully. Only move forward when current phase works. Document what IS, not what WILL BE.

Remember: A working simple system beats a broken complex system every time.
