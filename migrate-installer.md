# how does the /migrate-installer in claude code work on a linux debian computer?

The `/migrate-installer` command in Claude Code on a Debian (or other Linux) system is used to migrate your Claude Code installation from a global (system-wide, usually npm-managed) context to a local user-based installation. This migration addresses common permission issues and makes future updates and management easier without needing root privileges.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3]

### How `/migrate-installer` Works

- When run (`claude migrate-installer`), Claude copies all relevant binaries and configuration files from the global location (often `/usr/local/bin` or wherever npm installed it) into your user's home directory, typically under `~/.claude/local/`.
- The script then sets up an alias or a symlink in your shell configuration (such as `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or similar) to ensure that running `claude` from the terminal uses the local version going forward.
- No `sudo` privileges are required after migration—updates and usage are entirely user-owned.
- After running the command, it's important to restart your shell or source your profile for the PATH/alias changes to take effect.[^1_2][^1_3]


### Steps and Verification

1. Run:

```
claude migrate-installer
```

2. Restart the terminal or source your shell configuration:

```
source ~/.profile   # or ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, as appropriate
```

3. Verify the migration by running:

```
which claude
```

This should show the path as `~/.claude/local/claude` or point to the local install.[^1_2]
4. It's also a good idea to check installation health with:

```
claude doctor
```


### Why Migrate?

- Many Linux (and Mac) users run into permission errors or updater failures when using globally installed CLI tools via `npm`. By migrating, these issues are avoided, and no root access (`sudo`) is required in the future.[^1_3][^1_1]
- This method also avoids conflicting with other globally-installed Node.js or npm packages.


### Additional Notes

- After migrating, any IDE integrations (like with VS Code) may need reconfiguration to point to the new path if they don't automatically detect it.[^1_4]
- If you ever need to completely remove Claude Code, you can delete the `~/.claude` directory and remove the relevant lines from your shell configuration.

This process is considered the safest and most robust way to manage Claude Code on Debian and similar Linux distributions, especially for advanced users who want rootless, update-friendly configurations.[^1_1][^1_3][^1_2]

# why is the default installation global then? is this a trade off situation?

The default installation method for Claude Code is global because it matches longstanding Unix and npm conventions where CLI tools are installed system-wide and made available to all users and shells without needing to modify per-user configuration.[^2_1][^2_2][^2_3]

### Why Global by Default?

- **Simplicity and Tradition:** Most users expect commands installed with `npm install -g` to be immediately available everywhere, just like other CLIs (e.g., git, node).[^2_2][^2_1]
- **Universal Accessibility:** System-wide installations make the CLI available to all users and environments without duplicating files in user directories.[^2_3][^2_2]


### Trade-Offs of Global Installation

| Parameter | Global install | Local install |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Permissions** | Requires sudo for upgrades, some changes[^2_3] | Needs no sudo; managed by user[^2_3] |
| **Auto-updates** | Often restricted or disabled[^2_3] | Freely supported, rootless updates[^2_3] |
| **Configuration** | Central but less flexible[^2_3] | Per-user, easily customized[^2_3] |
| **Conflict Risk** | Can clash with other npm CLIs; sudo risk[^2_3] | No system conflict, safe from global npm[^2_3] |
| **Best for** | Shared/multi-user systems, tradition[^2_2] | Developer desktops, advanced usage[^2_2] |

### Why Migrate to Local?

- Migrating to a local installation is mostly recommended for developers who want unfettered updating, avoid permission issues, and minimize risk of breaking other global npm packages.[^2_4][^2_2][^2_3]
- The local approach is increasingly promoted for modern dev tooling, because it respects user boundaries and drastically simplifies maintenance.[^2_4]

Ultimately, the global installation is the default for compatibility and wider accessibility, but the local migration offers better flexibility, security, and autonomy for individual developers—a genuine trade-off situation that favors local installs for long-term stability.[^2_2][^2_3][^2_4]
