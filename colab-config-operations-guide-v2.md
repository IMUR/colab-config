# Colab-Config: Goal-Oriented Operations Guide

## Philosophy Statement

This guide establishes **goals and principles** rather than prescriptive implementations. Local agents, AI collaborators, and human operators should use these guidelines to make context-aware decisions that best serve the immediate needs while maintaining architectural coherence.

> **Core Principle**: Define the "what" and "why", let local context determine the "how"

## üìç Foundational Infrastructure Decisions

### Repository Location Standardization

```yaml
Goal: Consistent Local Repository Placement
  Rationale:
    - Scripts can assume known paths
    - Tools can hard-code locations safely
    - Reduces configuration complexity
    
  Considerations for Path Selection:
    - Should survive system reinstalls?
      ‚Üí Consider /opt/colab-config or /srv/colab-config
    - Should be user-accessible?
      ‚Üí Consider /home/shared/colab-config
    - Should be on network storage?
      ‚Üí Consider /cluster-nas/colab/colab-config
    - Should be node-local for performance?
      ‚Üí Consider /var/lib/colab-config
      
  Success Criteria:
    - Same path works on all nodes
    - Permissions appropriate for use case
    - Backup/sync strategy clear
    
  Document Decision:
    Chosen Path: [selected location]
    Rationale: [why this location]
    Sync Method: [how updates propagate]
```

### Git Repository Self-Hosting

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Principles

### 1. Container Strategy Framework

```yaml
Decision Framework for Container Selection:

When Infrastructure/Configuration Services Needed:
  Consider: Podman
  Because:
    - Rootless operation enhances security
    - SystemD integration simplifies management
    - Better for system-level services
  Examples:
    - Configuration management agents
    - Local development environments
    - System monitoring collectors
    - Infrastructure automation tools

When Application Services Needed:
  Consider: Docker/Kubernetes
  Because:
    - Ecosystem compatibility
    - Orchestration maturity
    - Community support
  Examples:
    - Web applications
    - Database services
    - ML model serving
    - User-facing services

Let local context determine the specific choice
```

### 2. Configuration Domain Guidelines

```yaml
Domain Classification Framework:

  Characteristics:
    - Set once during bootstrap
    - Changes require rebuild
    - Foundation for everything else
  Examples:
    - Network interface naming
    - Partition layout
    - Boot parameters
  Management Approach:
    - Bootstrap scripts
    - Image-based deployment
    - Hardware configuration

System Domain:
  Characteristics:
    - Changes infrequently
    - Requires root privileges
    - Affects all users
  Examples:
    - Package installation
    - Kernel parameters
    - System services
  Management Approach:
    - Configuration management tool
    - Declarative definitions
    - Version controlled

Service Domain:
  Characteristics:
    - Changes regularly
    - Isolated from system
    - Version specific
  Examples:
    - Application servers
    - Database instances
    - API services
  Management Approach:
    - Container orchestration
    - Service definitions
    - Rolling updates

User Domain:
  Characteristics:
    - Personal preferences
    - No root required
    - Highly variable
  Examples:
    - Shell configuration
    - Editor settings
    - Development tools
  Management Approach:
    - Dotfile management
    - User templates
    - Personal overrides
```

### Foundational Infrastructure Dependencies

```yaml
Interconnected Decisions:
  Repository Location + Storage Architecture:
    - If repo on network storage: prioritize storage reliability
    - If repo node-local: need sync mechanism
    - If repo replicated: consider git vs filesystem sync
    
  Git Hosting + Repository Location:
    - Self-hosted git: where does it live?
    - Multiple clones: how do they sync?
    - Development workflow: where do changes originate?
    
  Storage Architecture + Service Deployment:
    - Container volumes: local or network?
    - Database storage: performance vs durability
    - Configuration distribution: push or pull?

Decision Sequence Recommendation:
  1. First: Determine network storage architecture
     ‚Üí This affects everything else
  
  2. Second: Establish repository location standard
     ‚Üí Based on storage capabilities
  
  3. Third: Implement git hosting solution
     ‚Üí Based on repo location and storage

Example Scenarios:
  Scenario A: "Performance-Focused"
    - Local NVMe for active repo clones
    - Network storage for backups only
    - Git server on dedicated node
    
  Scenario B: "Reliability-Focused"
    - All repos on redundant network storage
    - Multiple git mirrors for availability
    - Automated failover mechanisms
    
  Scenario C: "Simplicity-Focused"
    - Single NFS mount for everything
    - External git hosting (GitHub)
    - Minimal local state
```

## üìê Implementation Patterns

### Organizational Patterns

Choose the pattern that best fits your mental model:

```yaml
Pattern A: Domain-Driven Structure

```

### Configuration Patterns

```yaml
Pattern: Variable Hierarchy
  defaults.yaml      # Base values
  role_vars.yaml     # Role overrides
  host_vars.yaml     # Host overrides
  local_vars.yaml    # Local overrides
  
  Decision Criteria:
    - How specific is this value?
    - How often does it change?
    - Who needs to modify it?

Pattern: Template Inheritance
  base.template      # Common structure
  role.template      # Role additions
  host.template      # Host specifics
  
  Decision Criteria:
    - How much variation exists?
    - What's the common denominator?
    - Where does uniqueness appear?

Pattern: Feature Toggles
  features:
    monitoring: enabled
    gpu_support: auto
    development_tools: optional
  
  Decision Criteria:
    - Is this always needed?
    - Can it be detected?
    - Should users choose?
```

### Thunderbolt 3 Implementation Guide

```yaml
Enabling Thunderbolt Networking:
  Step 1: Physical Connection
    ‚úì Already connected (per your note)
    - Verify cable is Thunderbolt 3 (not just USB-C)
    - Check both ports support Thunderbolt
    
  Step 2: Enable Thunderbolt Networking
    On both prtr and drtr:
      # Load thunderbolt-net module
      modprobe thunderbolt-net
      
      # Make persistent
      echo "thunderbolt-net" >> /etc/modules
      
      # Configure network (example)
      # /etc/network/interfaces.d/thunderbolt
      auto tb0
      iface tb0 inet static
        address 10.0.0.1/24  # prtr
        # or
        address 10.0.0.2/24  # drtr
        mtu 65520  # Jumbo frames for performance
    
  Step 3: Performance Testing
    # Test throughput
    iperf3 -s  # on one node
    iperf3 -c 10.0.0.1  # on other node
    
    Expected: 20-32 Gbps real-world
    vs Gigabit: 0.94 Gbps real-world
    
  Step 4: Storage Configuration
    Option A: Distributed Storage
      - Deploy GlusterFS across prtr/drtr
      - Use Thunderbolt for replication
      - Present unified volume to all nodes
      
    Option B: Fast NFS
      - Export from prtr (more RAM/storage)
      - Mount on drtr via Thunderbolt
      - Other nodes via regular ethernet
      
    Option C: DRBD Replication
      - Real-time block replication
      - Active/passive or active/active
      - Automatic failover capability

Use Case Scenarios:
  ML Training Workflow:
    1. Dataset lives on Thunderbolt storage
    2. GPU nodes access at 32Gb/s
    3. Results replicate to NAS
    4. Backups to external storage
    
  Development Workflow:
    1. Code repo on crtr (git server)
    2. Working copies on local storage
    3. Build artifacts on Thunderbolt storage
    4. Deployments from NAS
    
  Service Architecture:
    1. Databases on Thunderbolt storage
    2. Container images on local storage
    3. Configs and secrets on NAS
    4. Logs aggregate to crtr
```

### Git Repository Architecture

```yaml
Recommended: Distributed Git with Thunderbolt Optimization

Primary Repository (crtr):
  - Gitea or Soft-serve (ARM compatible)
  - Lightweight, always available
  - Web interface on gateway
  - Hooks for CI/CD triggers
  
Performance Mirrors (prtr/drtr):
  - Git mirrors over Thunderbolt
  - Sub-second sync between nodes
  - Local clone performance
  - Automatic failover
  
Implementation:
  # On crtr (primary)
  /srv/git/colab-config.git  # Bare repository
  
  # On prtr/drtr (mirrors)
  /opt/git-mirror/colab-config.git  # Pull mirror
  
  # Sync mechanism
  - Post-receive hook on crtr
  - Push to Thunderbolt mirrors
  - Near-instant propagation
  
Benefits:
  - Clones from local node (fast)
  - Pushes to crtr (authoritative)
  - Thunderbolt sync (instant)
  - Survives node failures
```

### Recommended Architecture Decision

```yaml
Optimal Configuration for Your Hardware:

Storage Architecture:
  ‚úÖ Keep crtr as primary NAS server
  ‚úÖ Enable Thunderbolt networking ASAP
  ‚úÖ Create GlusterFS volume across prtr/drtr
  ‚úÖ Use tiered storage approach
  
Repository Location:
  ‚úÖ /cluster-nas/colab/colab-config (shared)
  ‚úÖ Local cache in /opt/colab-cache/ (performance)
  ‚úÖ Thunderbolt sync for prtr/drtr
  
Git Hosting:
  ‚úÖ Gitea on crtr (ARM build available)
  ‚úÖ Mirror repositories via Thunderbolt
  ‚úÖ GitHub as external backup
  
Why This Works:
  - Leverages Thunderbolt's massive bandwidth
  - Keeps crtr's role simple and stable
  - Utilizes prtr's huge RAM for caching
  - Provides multiple failure domains
  - Scales with your workload
```

    - CI/CD integration
    
  Not Needed:
    - [Define based on team needs]
```

### Repository Standardization Process

```yaml
Implementation Steps:
  1. Survey Current State
     - Where are configs now?
     - What references exist?
     - What breaks if moved?
     
  2. Define Standard Location
     - Consider all constraints
     - Document decision rationale
     - Plan migration path
     
  3. Create Migration Tools
     - Symlink for compatibility
     - Update scripts gradually
     - Verify functionality
     
  4. Communicate Changes
     - Update documentation
     - Notify all users
     - Provide transition period

Location Decision Matrix:
  /opt/colab-config:
    ‚úì Survives reinstalls
    ‚úì Standard for third-party software
    ‚úó Requires root to modify
    
  /srv/colab-config:
    ‚úì Designed for site-specific data
    ‚úì Clear purpose
    ‚úó Less commonly used
    
  /cluster-nas/colab-config:
    ‚úì Shared across all nodes
    ‚úì Centralized management
    ‚úó Depends on network storage
    
  /var/lib/colab-config:
    ‚úì Standard for variable data
    ‚úì Service-oriented location
    ‚úó May be cleared on cleanup
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls to Avoid

### Hardware-Specific Warnings

```yaml
Don't Overload crtr:
  ‚ùå Running databases on Raspberry Pi
  ‚ùå Hosting container registries
  ‚ùå CPU-intensive monitoring
  ‚úÖ Keep it simple: NFS, Git, Gateway

Don't Waste Thunderbolt:
  ‚ùå Using it only for backup
  ‚ùå Forgetting jumbo frames
  ‚ùå Single-direction transfers
  ‚úÖ Bidirectional, high-throughput workloads

Don't Ignore Memory:
  ‚ùå Not using prtr's 128GB RAM
  ‚ùå Small cache settings
  ‚ùå Swapping to disk
  ‚úÖ Aggressive caching, tmpfs, in-memory ops

Don't Complicate Early:
  ‚ùå Kubernetes on 3 nodes
  ‚ùå Complex storage solutions before basics
  ‚ùå Over-engineering resilience
  ‚úÖ Start simple, evolve as needed

Common Mistakes:
  ARM Compatibility:
    - Not all software works on crtr
    - Check ARM builds before committing
    - Have x86 fallback plan
    
  Network Bottlenecks:
    - Everything through 1Gb ethernet
    - Not using Thunderbolt link
    - Single NFS server for all
    
  Storage Waste:
    - Empty local disks (888GB unused!)
    - Everything on slow NAS
    - No caching strategy
```

## üéØ Meta-Goals

The ultimate success criteria:

1. **Clarity of Purpose** - Anyone can understand our goals
2. **Flexibility of Implementation** - Multiple valid paths exist
3. **Resilience to Change** - System adapts without breaking
4. **Joy in Operations** - Working with system is pleasant
5. **Continuous Learning** - Every incident improves us

## üìù Living Document Notice

This guide is intentionally high-level and goal-oriented. It should evolve based on:

- Lessons learned from implementations
- Feedback from team members
- Changes in technology landscape
- Shifts in organizational needs

**Remember**: The best solution is the one that works for your context, not the one that looks best on paper.
