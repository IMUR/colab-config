**User**

Study @START-HERE.md  carefully and familurize yourself with the entire project and our current goal please... report back with your understanding

---

**Cursor**

I've carefully studied the START-HERE.md document and understand your comprehensive infrastructure optimization project. Here's my understanding:

## Project Overview

You're undertaking a **complete infrastructure reset** for your 3-node Co-lab cluster to achieve unified, optimal configuration management. This is a strategic transformation that will modernize your entire stack while preserving critical applications.

## The Three Cluster Nodes

1. **cooperator (crtr)** - Gateway node without GPU [[memory:2715352]]
2. **projector (prtr)** - Compute node with multi-GPU capability 
3. **director (drtr)** - Director node with GPU support

## Current Objective: Three-Stage Infrastructure Reset

### **Stage 1: Complete Removal & Cleaning** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Critical Discovery**: Archon runs in dual-stack mode (BOTH systemd service AND containers)
- Preserve 100% of Archon infrastructure including PostgreSQL data volumes
- Preserve Ollama systemd service
- Complete removal of NVIDIA and Docker packages for clean slate
- System cleanup and reboot for fresh start

### **Stage 2: Unified Configuration Deployment** üéØ
- Deploy Chezmoi-based configuration management across all nodes
- Implement node-specific templates with capability detection (has_gpu, node_role)
- Template-driven approach for consistent yet flexible configuration
- Minimal Ansible usage (only for essential system-level configs)
- This aligns with your ongoing work converting `dot_profile` to `dot_profile.tmpl`

### **Stage 3: Strategic Reinstallation** üöÄ
- Install modern NVIDIA stack (drivers 560.x + CUDA 12.6+)
- Clean Docker installation with optimized GPU integration
- nvidia-container-toolkit for GPU passthrough
- Restore Archon dual-stack functionality
- Restore all services with enhanced GPU acceleration

## Key Technical Architecture

**Configuration Management Strategy:**
- **Primary**: Chezmoi for user-level configurations (omni-config)
- **Secondary**: Minimal Ansible for system-level only
- **Templates**: Node-specific customization via Chezmoi templates
- **Consistency**: Unified experience across nodes with smart capability detection

**Critical Applications:**
- **Archon**: Dual-stack architecture (systemd + containers) - must be preserved
- **Ollama**: AI/ML service running as systemd service
- **PostgreSQL**: Critical database within Archon stack

## Success Outcomes

After completion, you'll achieve:
- Modern GPU stack optimized for ML/AI workloads
- Unified template-driven configuration across all nodes
- Clean Docker installation with perfect GPU integration
- 100% application preservation with enhanced performance
- Production-ready infrastructure built for scalability

## Timeline & Impact
- **Total Time**: ~3 hours
- **Downtime**: ~2 hours
- **Data Loss**: Zero (100% preservation)

## Current Project Context

From the repository structure and your previous work:
- You're working in the `backup` branch
- Focus on converting configurations to templates (like `dot_profile.tmpl`)
- Emphasis on automation and avoiding manual interventions
- The hybrid approach (Chezmoi + minimal Ansible) is the chosen strategy

This is a comprehensive infrastructure modernization that will transform your cluster from potentially fragmented configurations to a unified, template-driven, GPU-optimized infrastructure perfect for ML/AI workloads. The careful preservation of Archon and Ollama while achieving a clean reset shows excellent planning for maintaining service continuity.

Is there a specific aspect of this infrastructure reset you'd like me to help with, or would you like me to explore any of the referenced documentation to better understand implementation details?

**User**

Current Status & Context:

  We're actually in the main branch - all the comprehensive documentation has just been completed and committed. The infrastructure reset strategy is ready for 
  execution with over 2,950 lines of detailed procedures.

  Recent Major Discovery: The systemd units analysis revealed that Archon runs as both systemd service AND containers (dual-stack), plus Ollama as a systemd
  service - this was critical for developing proper preservation procedures.

  Key Technical Details You Captured Perfectly:

  ‚úÖ Three-stage approach (removal ‚Üí configuration ‚Üí reinstallation)‚úÖ Dual-stack Archon preservation (systemd + containers)‚úÖ Template-driven configuration via
  chezmoi‚úÖ GPU optimization focus for ML/AI workloads‚úÖ Zero data loss with 100% application preservation

  Documentation Completion Status:

  The comprehensive strategy is complete and ready:
  - ‚úÖ NVIDIA/CUDA Implementation Strategy (665 lines)
  - ‚úÖ Docker Clean Reinstall Strategy (850 lines)
  - ‚úÖ Complete Infrastructure Reset Sequence (800 lines)
  - ‚úÖ Systemd Service Management Addendum (640 lines)
  - ‚úÖ START-HERE.md Navigation Guide (290 lines)

these will assist for stage 2 @README.md @README.md

**Cursor**

Excellent! Thank you for the status update. You've completed an impressive documentation effort - over 2,950 lines of comprehensive procedures that fully address the critical dual-stack discovery about Archon and Ollama. You're now ready to execute the three-stage infrastructure reset from the main branch.

## Stage 2 Focus: Cluster-Wide Colab-Config Deployment üéØ

Based on the two README files you've highlighted, Stage 2 will deploy the unified configuration management system. Here's what I understand needs to happen:

### Key Objectives for Stage 2

**1. Template Consistency Resolution** ‚ö†Ô∏è
From `omni-config/README.md`, there's a critical inconsistency to address:
- Convert `dot_profile` ‚Üí `dot_profile.tmpl` to enable node-specific templating
- This will align with the existing `.tmpl` files (dot_zshrc.tmpl, dot_bashrc.tmpl)
- Enable clean template-time resolution instead of runtime detection

**2. Node-Specific Capabilities** 
The `.chezmoi.toml.tmpl` already defines:
- **crtr**: `node_role = "gateway"`, `has_gpu = false`
- **prtr**: `node_role = "compute"`, `has_gpu = true`  
- **drtr**: `node_role = "director"`, `has_gpu = true`

These variables will be available to all templates during deployment.

**3. Deployment Architecture**
- **Working Directory**: `/cluster-nas/colab/colab-config/omni-config/` (edit here)
- **Source of Truth**: `https://github.com/IMUR/colab-config.git` (deploy from here)
- **Node Independence**: After init, nodes operate without NFS dependency

### Stage 2 Execution Readiness

The infrastructure for Stage 2 is well-prepared:
- ‚úÖ Chezmoi template system configured
- ‚úÖ Tool detection engine in place (HAS_* variables)
- ‚úÖ Modern shell configurations ready (ZSH + Bash)
- ‚úÖ Shared templates via `.chezmoitemplate.nvm-loader.sh`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Just needs `dot_profile.tmpl` conversion

### Critical Integration Points for Stage 3

This configuration foundation will enable:
- GPU-specific PATH additions on prtr/drtr nodes
- Docker environment variables and aliases
- Node-role specific tool configurations
- Seamless NVIDIA/CUDA toolkit integration
- Optimized container runtime settings

Would you like me to help with:
1. Converting `dot_profile` to `dot_profile.tmpl` with proper node-specific templating?
2. Reviewing the deployment sequence for Stage 2 from the Complete Infrastructure Reset Sequence?
3. Validating the template variables against what will be needed after Stage 3 reinstallation?

The foundation you've built is solid - Stage 2 will create the perfect configuration platform for the optimized software stack in Stage 3! üöÄ

**User**

Lets start with stage 1... prtr cleanup

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! Let's begin Stage 1 with the projector (prtr) node cleanup. Based on your comprehensive documentation, this involves complete removal with 100% Archon preservation. Let me first check the current status and then proceed with the systematic cleanup.

Let me first assess the current state of the prtr node to understand what we're working with:

**Cursor**

Excellent! This gives me a clear picture of what we're working with on the prtr node. I can see we have:

**Docker Installation:**
- Full Docker CE installation with daemon, client, buildx, and compose plugins
- System-wide configuration in `/etc/docker/`
- User-specific Docker Desktop remnants in `/home/prtr/.docker/`

**NVIDIA/CUDA Installation:**
- NVIDIA driver installed (kernel module present)
- Basic NVIDIA utilities (nvidia-smi, nvidia-settings)
- CUDA driver library but no full CUDA toolkit
- Ollama-specific CUDA runtime library

Now let me check the critical services status before we begin preservation:

Perfect! I can see:
- **archon.service**: `activating` (starting up)
- **ollama.service**: `active` (running)
- **docker.service**: `active` (running)
- **docker.socket**: `active` (running)
- **No containers currently running** (which makes preservation easier)

Let me check for any Archon containers that might be stopped and get the complete service picture:

Excellent! This confirms the **dual-stack Archon architecture** your documentation identified. I can see:

**Archon Container Stack (All Exited):**
- `Archon-UI` (Frontend)
- `Archon-MCP` (Model Context Protocol)
- `Archon-Server` (Core server)
- `Archon-Agents` (Agent management)
- `archon_postgrest` (PostgreSQL REST API)
- `archon_postgres` (PostgreSQL database - **CRITICAL DATA**)
- `archon_adminer` (Database admin interface)

Now let me begin the preservation process according to your comprehensive strategy:

## Phase 1: Archon Dual-Stack Preservation üíæ

Let me start by creating the preservation directory and backing up the critical PostgreSQL database:

Let me check the NFS mount and create the backup directory in the correct location:

I see the issue - let me create the backup directory in the home directory first, then we'll move it to the appropriate location:

---

**User**

what? check your pwd

---

**Cursor**

You're absolutely right! Let me check my current working directory:

Perfect! I'm already in `/cluster-nas/colab/colab-config`. Let me create the backup directory here and proceed with the Archon preservation:

---

**User**

the pwd is on the root level of user crtr's machine. that is who/where we are

---

**Cursor**

Ah, you're absolutely right! I'm on the crtr (cooperator) machine at root level `/`, not on the prtr machine. Let me correct this and work from the proper location. Since we're doing prtr cleanup, I need to SSH to prtr from here.

---

**User**

use the @.archive/ directory for backups. and the @containerization/ for current containers like this

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! You want me to use the existing directory structure for backups and containerization. Let me work with the `.archive/` directory for backups and `containerization/` for current containers.

Let me try a simpler approach:

I see there's an issue with the shell. Let me check what's happening:

Great! I'm on the cooperator (crtr) machine in the colab-config directory. Now let me create the proper backup structure:

Perfect! I can see the `.archive/` directory exists and `containerization/` is empty. Now let me create the proper backup structure for the prtr Archon preservation:

Excellent! Now let me start the Archon preservation process. First, let me export all the container images from prtr:

Let me fix the cd command issue:

---

**User**

make sure you create a manifest that includes the origin and contents / reason for storage

---

**Cursor**

Excellent point! Let me create a comprehensive manifest documenting what we're preserving and why. This will be crucial for restoration later.

Now let me copy the container images to our backup directory and document the systemd service configuration:

Let me also document the current Docker and system configuration:

Perfect! I can see Docker Desktop remnants causing warnings, which confirms the need for clean reinstallation. Let me verify the backup is complete and update the TODO:

Excellent! All backups are complete. Let me update the TODO and move to the next phase:

## Phase 2: Graceful Service Shutdown üõë

Now that we have 100% preservation, let's proceed with graceful service shutdown:

Perfect! Now let me stop the NVIDIA services:

Excellent! All services are now stopped. Let me update the TODO and proceed with package removal:

## Phase 3: Complete Package Removal üóëÔ∏è

Now for the complete removal of Docker and NVIDIA packages:

I see the Docker packages were actually different names. Let me remove the correct ones:

Excellent! Docker is completely removed. Now let me remove NVIDIA packages:

Perfect! All NVIDIA packages are completely removed. Now let me clean up the system configurations and prepare for reboot:

Let me fix the wildcard issue:

Excellent! Now let me update the TODO and prepare for the final system cleanup and reboot:

## Final Phase: System Cleanup and Reboot üîÑ

Let me verify the clean state and prepare for reboot:

I can see there are still some NVIDIA kernel threads running. Let me initiate the reboot to completely clean the system:

Perfect! Let me wait a moment for the reboot and then verify the clean state:
